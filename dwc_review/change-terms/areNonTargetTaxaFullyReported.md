| **description** | Every dwc:Organism that was outside of the target taxonomic scope (the combination of eco:targetTaxonomicScope and eco:excludedTaxonomicScope) and detected during a dwc:Event, and that was detectable using the given protocol (given in eco:protocolDescriptions and dwc:samplingProtocol), was reported. |
| **comments** | This term is meant to inform a user of the data whether there were non-target taxa that were detected, but left unreported. This term is only relevant if a dwc:Event used restricted search or open search methods and if a target taxonomic scope is declared. Taxonomic scope is based on the combination of eco:targetTaxonomicScope and eco:excludedTaxonomicScope. Within dwc:Events that used either a restricted search or an open search method and declared a taxonomic scope, if all dwc:Organisms that are not included within the target taxonomic scope and that were detected during a dwc:Event were reported, the value of this term should be 'true', otherwise the value of this term should be â€˜false'. |
