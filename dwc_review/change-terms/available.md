| **key** |  |
| **title** | Available |
| **description** | Date (often a range) that the resource became or will become available. |
| **comments** | The date (often a range) that the resource became or will become available. The date and time MUST comply with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) datetime practice, https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime, which requires that date and time representation correspond to ISO 8601:1998, but with year fields always comprising 4 digits. This makes datetime records compliant with 8601:2004, https://www.iso.org/standard/40874.html. AC datetime values MAY also follow 8601:2004 for ranges by separating two IS0 8601 datetime fields by a solidus ("forward slash", '/'). A use case is the harvesting of metadata published before the media are available, which are pending a formal publication elsewhere. One important example is the case of metadata that documents an occurrence, which metadata harvesters might exploit without use of the media. See also the wikipedia IS0 8601 entry, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601, for further explanation and examples. |
