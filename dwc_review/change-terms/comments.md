| **description** | Any comment provided on the dwc:Media resource, as free-form text. |
| **comments** | Best practice would also identify the ac:commenter. Comments may refer to the resource itself (e. g., asserting a taxon name or location of a biological subject in an image), or to the relation between resource and associated metadata (e. g., asserting that the taxon name given in the metadata is wrong, without asserting a positive identification). There is a separate item from ac:reviewerComments, which is defined more as an expert-level review. Implementers or communities of practice might establish conventions about the meaning of the absence of an ac:commenter, but this specification is silent on that matter. |
