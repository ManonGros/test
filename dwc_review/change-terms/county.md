| **comments** | Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary such as the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names. Recommended best practice is to leave this field blank if the dcterms:Location spans multiple entities at this administrative level or if the dcterms:Location might be in one or another of multiple possible entities at this level. Multiplicity and uncertainty of the geographic entity can be captured either in the term dwc:higherGeography or in the term dwc:locality, or both. |
| **example** | `Missoula`; `Los Lagos`; `Matar√≥` |
