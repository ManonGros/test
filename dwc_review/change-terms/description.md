| **key** |  |
| **title** | Description |
| **description** | An account of the resource. |
| **comments** | Description of collection or individual resource, containing the Who, What, When, Where and Why as free-form text. This property optionally allows the presentation of detailed information and will in most cases be shown together with the resource title. If both a description and a caption are present in the metadata, a description is typically displayed instead of the resource, whereas a caption is displayed together with the resource. The description should aim to be a good proxy for the underlying media resource in cases where only text can be shown, whereas the caption may only make sense when shown together with the media. Thus, in HTML it would be appropriate to use dcterms:description values for alt attributes in img elements. Often only one of description or caption is present; choose the term most appropriate for your metadata. It is the role of implementers of an AC concrete representation (e.g., an XML Schema, an RDF representation, etc.) to decide and document how formatting advice will be represented in descriptions serialized according to such representations. |
