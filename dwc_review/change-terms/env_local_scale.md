| **description** | In this field, report the entity or entities which are in your sample or specimen’s local vicinity and which you believe have significant causal influences on your sample or specimen. Please use terms that are present in ENVO and which are of smaller spatial grain than your entry for env_broad_scale. Format (one term): termLabel [termID]; Format (multiple terms): termLabel [termID]|termLabel [termID]|termLabel [termID]. Example: Annotating a pooled sample taken from various vegetation layers in a forest consider: canopy [ENVO:00000047]|herb and fern layer [ENVO:01000337]|litter layer [ENVO:01000338]|understory [01000335]|shrub layer [ENVO:01000336]. If needed, request new terms on the ENVO tracker, identified here: http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/envo.html. |
