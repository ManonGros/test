| **description** | The decimal fraction representing the frequency (rate) at which consecutive images (frames) were captured in real time for a dcmi:MovingImage, expressed as the number of frames per second. |
| **comments** | This term represents the rate at which consecutive images were captured in real time, not the rate at which the media is encoded to play back the recording. For example, in a recording where 60 consecutive images (frames) are captured for each second of the real-time recording, this would be 60. In a time-lapse recording where one image (frame) is recorded every 5 seconds of recording, this would be 0.2. |
| **example** | `60`; `0.2` |
