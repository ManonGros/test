| **description** | A language of the resource. |
| **comments** | URI from the ISO639-2 list of URIs for ISO 3-letter language codes, http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2. An image may contain language such as superimposed labels. If an image is of a natural scene or organism, without any language included, the resource is language-neutral with URI http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/zxx corresponding to ISO ISO639-2 code "zxx". Resources with present but unknown language are to be coded as undetermined, with URI http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/und corresponding to ISO639-2 code "und". Regional dialects or other special cases should conform to the ISO639-5 Alpha-3 Code for Language Families and Groups, http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-5.html, where possible or the IETF Best Practices for Tags Identifying Languages, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646, where not. See also the entry for dc:language in the Audiovisual Core term list document and see the DCMI FAQ on DC and DCTERMS Namespaces, https://web.archive.org/web/20171126043657/https://github.com/dcmi/repository/blob/master/mediawiki_wiki/FAQ/DC_and_DCTERMS_Namespaces.md, for discussion of the rationale for terms in two namespaces. Normal practice is to use the same Label if both are provided. Labels have no effect on information discovery and are only suggestions. |
