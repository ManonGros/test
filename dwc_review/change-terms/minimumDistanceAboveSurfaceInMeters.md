## Term change

* Submitter: Darwin Core Data Package Coordination Team
* Efficacy Justification (why is this term necessary?): see [Darwin Core Data Package (DwC-DP) Implementation Experience and Feature Report](https://gbif.github.io/dwc-dp/docs/dwc_dp_implementation_feature_reports.pdf)
* Demand Justification (name at least two organizations that independently need this term): see [Darwin Core Data Package (DwC-DP) Implementation Experience and Feature Report](https://gbif.github.io/dwc-dp/docs/dwc_dp_implementation_feature_reports.pdf)
* Stability Justification (what concerns are there that this might affect existing implementations?): None
* Implications for dwciri: namespace (does this change affect a dwciri term version)?: To be determined by DwC-MG

Current Term definition: http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/minimumDistanceAboveSurfaceInMeters

Proposed attributes of the new term version (Please put actual changes to be implemented in **bold** and ~strikethrough~):

* Term name (in lowerCamelCase for properties, UpperCamelCase for classes): ~minimumDistanceAboveSurfaceInMeters~ **minimumDistanceAboveSurfaceInMeters**
* Term label (English, not normative): ~Minimum Distance Above Surface In Meters~ **Minimum Distance Above Surface In Meters**
* Organized in Class (e.g., Occurrence, Event, Location, Taxon): Event
* New definition of the term (normative): **A lesser distance in a range of distance from a reference surface in the vertical direction, in meters. Use positive values for locations above the surface, negative values for locations below. If depth measures are given, the reference surface is the location given by the depth, otherwise the reference surface is the location given by the elevation.**
* Previous definition of the term: ~The lesser distance in a range of distance from a reference surface in the vertical direction, in meters. Use positive values for locations above the surface, negative values for locations below. If depth measures are given, the reference surface is the location given by the depth, otherwise the reference surface is the location given by the elevation.~
* New usage comments (recommendations regarding content, etc., not normative): **** 
* Previous usage comments: ~~
* New examples (not normative): **`-1.5` (below the surface); `4.2` (above the surface); For a 1.5 meter sediment core from the bottom of a lake (at depth 20m) at 300m elevation: verbatimElevation: `300m` minimumElevationInMeters: `300`, maximumElevationInMeters: `300`, verbatimDepth: `20m`, minimumDepthInMeters: `20`, maximumDepthInMeters: `20`, minimumDistanceAboveSurfaceInMeters: `0`, maximumDistanceAboveSurfaceInMeters: `-1.5`.**

* Refines (identifier of the broader term this term refines; normative): http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/version/minimumDistanceAboveSurfaceInMeters-2023-06-28
* Replaces (identifier of the existing term that would be deprecated and replaced by this term; normative): 
* ABCD 2.06 (XPATH of the equivalent term in ABCD or EFG; not normative): DataSets/DataSet/Units/Unit/Gathering/Height/MeasurementOrFactAtomised/LowerValue
