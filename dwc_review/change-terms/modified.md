| **key** |  |
| **title** | Modified |
| **description** | Date on which the resource was changed. |
| **comments** | Date that the media resource was altered. The date and time MUST comply with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) datetime practice, https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime, which requires that date and time representation correspond to ISO 8601:1998, https://www.iso.org/standard/40874.html, but with year fields always comprising 4 digits. This makes datetime records compliant with 8601:2004. AC datetime values MAY also follow 8601:2004 for ranges by separating two IS0 8601 datetime fields by a solidus ("forward slash", '/'). dcterms:modified permits all modification dates to be recorded, or if only one is recorded, it is assumed to be the latest. See also the wikipedia IS0 8601 entry, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601, for further explanation and examples. |
