| **description** | A full, unabbreviated name of a next smaller administrative region than county (city, municipality, etc.) in which a dcterms:Location occurs. Do not use this term for a nearby named place that does not contain the actual location. |
| **comments** | Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary such as the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names. Recommended best practice is to leave this field blank if a dcterms:Location spans multiple entities at this administrative level or if a dcterms:Location might be in one or another of multiple possible entities at this level. Multiplicity and uncertainty of the geographic entity can be captured either in the term `higherGeography` or in the term `locality`, or both. |
