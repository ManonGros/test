| **description** | Cutoffs and approach used when clustering new UViGs in "species-level" OTUs. Note that results from standard 95% ANI / 85% AF clustering should be provided alongside OTUS defined from another set of thresholds, even if the latter are the ones primarily used during the analysis. |
