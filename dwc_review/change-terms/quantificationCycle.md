| **description** | The number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross a given value threshold above the baseline. Quantification cycle (Cq), threshold cycle (Ct), crossing point (Cp), and take-off point (TOP) refer to the same value from the real-time instrument. Use of quantification cycle (Cq), is preferable according to the RDML (Real-Time PCR Data Markup Language) data standard (http://www.rdml.org). |
