| **description** | Any comment provided by a reviewer with expertise in the subject, as free-form text. |
| **comments** | Reviewer Comments may refer to the resource itself (e. g., asserting a taxon name or location of a biological subject in an image), or to the relation between resource and associated metadata (e. g., asserting that the taxon name given in the metadata is wrong, without asserting a positive identification). There is a separate item "Comments" for text from commenters of unrecorded expertise. |
