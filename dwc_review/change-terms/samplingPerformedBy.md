| **description** | An dcterms:Agent responsible for sampling. |
| **comments** | The sampling dwc:Event could be at any level of hierarchy. In the case of a higher level (parent) dwc:Event, include all the organizations or people involved in the child dwc:Events that contributed to the parent dwc:Event. Recommended best practice is to separate multiple values in a list with space vertical bar space ( | ). This term has an equivalent in the dwciri: namespace that allows only an IRI as a value, whereas this term allows for any string literal value. |
