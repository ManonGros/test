| **description** | This should provide further information about the genetic distinctness of the sequenced organism by recording additional information e.g. serovar, serotype, biotype, ecotype, or any relevant genetic typing schemes like Group I plasmid. It can also contain alternative taxonomic information. It should contain both the lineage name, and the lineage rank, i.e. biovar:abc123. |
