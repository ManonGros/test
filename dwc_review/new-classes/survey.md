## New term

* Submitter: Darwin Core Data Package Coordination Team
* Efficacy Justification (why is this term necessary?): see [Darwin Core Data Package (DwC-DP) Implementation Experience and Feature Report](https://gbif.github.io/dwc-dp/docs/dwc_dp_implementation_feature_reports.pdf)
* Demand Justification (name at least two organizations that independently need this term): see [Darwin Core Data Package (DwC-DP) Implementation Experience and Feature Report](https://gbif.github.io/dwc-dp/docs/dwc_dp_implementation_feature_reports.pdf)
* Stability Justification (what concerns are there that this might affect existing implementations?): None
* Implications for dwciri: namespace (does this change affect a dwciri term version)?: To be determined by DwC-MG

* Examples (not normative): `a botanical survey of a protected area to assess native and invasive plant species`; `a wetland vegetation mapping`; `a camera trap deployment in a rainforest to monitor large mammals`; `a frog call survey in wetlands across breeding seasons`; `a coverboard survey for reptiles in forested environments`; `a pollinator survey in an agricultural landscape`; `a macroinvertebrate sampling in a freshwater stream to assess water quality`; `a habitat- or ecosystem-level survey (e.g., coral reef health assessment, forest biodiversity assessment)`; `an environmental impact assessment (e.g., pre-construction biological baseline survey for a wind farm project)`
* Refines (identifier of the broader term this term refines; normative): 
* Replaces (identifier of the existing term that would be deprecated and replaced by this term; normative):
